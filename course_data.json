  "course_overview": "Artificial intelligence is taking the world by storm. Machines are making decisions and automating the processes and systems. With generative AI, machines can generate text, images and audio on demand of users.\n\nIn this course, you will learn to generate a job portfolio using prompt engineering. In prompt engineering, you give the description of the task to the chatbot and it generates the required information. We ask ChatGPT to generate the cover letters, resumes, emails, and LinkedIn profiles. You will learn to modify and update the prompts to get an improved response. The portfolio is updated based on the userâ€™s skills and the job description, matching the two. You will learn to use ChatGPT to find the right job based on your skills and experience.\n\nBy the end of the course, you will have learned to effectively write prompts. You should be able to create prompts for various tasks. The prompts can be used for other AI tools as well, and not only for text, but also for images.",
